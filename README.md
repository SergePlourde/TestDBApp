# TestDBApp
Android Application Project to explore and experiment with the functionalities related to managing a database locally on a Android device.

The database is named activitytimesheet.db

This activity journal (time sheet) database consists of an activity log (the activitylog table) which keeps tracks of date and time an activity (with optional activity group and activity description) is started and ended, and it is using activities (activity table), activity groups (activitygroup table), activity combos (activity/activity group pairs) for quicker data entry. 
This is a sub-project of my "SimpleActivityTracker" personal project.

I think it could be useful to anyone who would like to learn a "basic" Android Database app.

The Database Management menu has those menu items:
Delete Database
Expoert Activity Journal Database
Import into Activity Journal
Make Test Data
Wipe Out Activity Journal Database

That is about all the basic functionalities this kind of Android App should have.
